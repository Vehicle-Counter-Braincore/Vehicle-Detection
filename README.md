# Vehicle-Detection

This project focuses on implementing a vehicle detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The system processes input video streams or images to identify and count vehicles, classifying them into five categories: motorcycle, car, bus, truck, and background.

## Used Dataset
The model is trained using the dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshamjn/vehicle-detection-8-classes-object-detection/data)

## Saved Model
The trained models, including the best and final versions, can be accessed via this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H9qzosOMBaclm8m4TIF4jCfh7zp0UNLw?usp=sharing)
